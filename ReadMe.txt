The Task:

Create an in memory implementation of IRepository<T> 

Hints:

It is best to develop the solution with a Test Driven approach. The unit test code is as important as the implementation.
NUnit has been referenced in the setup, but feel free to use any other packages you feel comfortable with.

Keep the solution simple. We value SOLID principles, but we're not looking for over engineered design.

The code should be self-explanatory, documentation should not be required to understand the code.
